<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Lourence. I am currently working as a Service Supervisor in a Security Systems company. I am living in Manila with my partner and six shih tzu dogs.</p>

<p>I finished my studies in Polytechnic Univeristy of the Philippines in Manila as Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. Right when I graduated in 2004, I worked in Saudi Arabia as a security systems technician specializing in CCTV and Alarm systems. I wasn't able to practice what I learned in school. the next job that I took are all related in security systems.</p>

<p>Right now, I want to review and learn more about web develpoment. I want to have a side hustle and I believe having the skills to create websites can help me achieve this. I purchased Angela Yu's course in Udemy to help me learn the basics again and be equipped with the necessary skills to make my own portfolio and to offer my services to others. I am happy that started this course and I believe I can finish this completely and acquire the skills that will help me on my dreams. One step at a time.</p>
